# Quantum Two-Qubit Circuit

This is implemented with [cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) to simulate a two-qubit swap circuit.

This was done as a part of my midterm exam for "Quantum Software Engineering" course in university.

The result can be seen in `result.txt`

The circuit is depicted and explained in the book "Nielsen, M. A., & Chuang, I. L. (2010). Quantum Computation and Quantum Information: 10th Anniversary Edition. Cambridge University Press. page 23"
